## Number Game 🎲

**Description:** A fun number guessing game where you try to guess a random number within a specified range.

**How it works:**

3. The program compares your guess with the generated number and provides feedback:
   - If your guess is correct, you win! 🎉
   - If your guess is too high, you'll be informed.
   - If your guess is too low, you'll be informed.
4. You can keep guessing until you get the correct number.
